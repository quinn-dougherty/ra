# 1.4 

ordered field properties should probably have a cheatsheet written

# 1.6: inequalities

### theorem 1.9
let $$x,y \in \mathbb{R}$$
1. $$|-x| \eq |x|, x \leq |x|, |x| = max\{x, -x\}$$
2. $$|xy| \eq |x| |y|$$
3. $$|x+y| \leq |x| + |y|$$
4. $$| |x| + |y| | \leq |x-y|$$

If i just do all the exercises these rules will be internalized and I won't need to look them up in a cheatsheet lol 

### Cauchy-Schwarz inequality 

for vectors $$a,b$$, dot product $$a \cdot b$$, and euclidean length $$||a||$$, 

$${a \cdot b}^{2} \leq {||a||}^{2} {||b||}^{2} $$
