## `.ipynb` files

The `.ipynb` filetype _should_ render in github, but it doesn't sometimes. If it doesn't, open it in `colab` by changing the url like so: 

You can manually transform the url `https://github.com/quinn-dougherty/ra/blob/master/cheatsheet.ipynb` by erasing `.com`, and between `https://` and `github/user-name/...` write `colab.research.google.com/`. So the url is this: 

`https://colab.research.google.com/github/quinn-dougherty/ra/blob/master/cheatsheet.ipynb`

I think `.ipynb` is the best/easiest way to get latex, since regular github markdown (the syntax/format i'm writing this readme in) can't actually render latex by itself. 

You can save copies to gdrive or commit to github from within colab. 

## camscanner

I use an app called CamScanner. (honestly my notes on lecture 1 aren't that useful, I need to type them up and actually make them readable to someone who wasn't there, i just haven't had time.) 

## git and github

I will literally teach anyone git/github, it's an important life skill, and we can have a big group pile of notes.
