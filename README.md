# Real Analysis

Pulling variously from Howie, Pugh, Baby Rudin, and Abbott. 

lectures by Brenton Webber at CCP

## `.ipynb` files

The `.ipynb` filetype _should_ render in github, but it doesn't sometimes. If it doesn't, open it in `colab` by changing the url. 



I think `.ipynb` is the best/easiest way to get latex, since regular github markdown (the syntax/format i'm writing this readme in) can't actually render latex by itself. 

## camscanner

I use an app called CamScanner. (honestly my notes on lecture 1 aren't that useful, I need to type them up and actually make them readable to someone who wasn't there, i just haven't had time.) 

## git and github

I will literally teach anyone git/github, it's an important life skill, and we can have a big group pile of notes.
